A very simple library to read the NetCDF altimetry data of TOPEX and JASON-1. The objective here is automate the procedure of making the datasets ready to use. This include reading how all the required NetCDF files, sub-sampling by desired time/period and creating an accumulated intuitive dictionary of the pertinent data.

Although not yet implemented the most interesting feature would be a "TOPEX" class, which would make very simple and intuitive to load, sub-sample and deal with these datasets.
